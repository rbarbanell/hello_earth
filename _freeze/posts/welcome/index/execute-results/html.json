Based on our analysis it is clear who the best player of all times is and we can finally put these debates to rest.\n\n<img src=\"three.jpg\"/>\n\n## The Data {background-color=\"rgba(223,187,133,.6)\"}\n\nWe based our findings off of various datasets from Kaggle.com.\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   NBA Players stats from 1950-2017\n-   Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James stats through 2019\n:::\n\n## Back to Basics {background-color=\"rgba(223,187,133,.6)\"}\n\nFirst we looked at some basic aggregates to see if a top player emerged.\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n### **Michael Jordan**\n\n-   15 seasons\n-   1072 games\n-   [**6 NBA championships**]{style=\"color: #980239;\"}\n-   [**5x NBA MVP**]{style=\"color: #980239;\"}\n-   14x NBA All-Star\n-   32,292 career points\n-   [**30.1 PPG**]{style=\"color: #980239;\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n### **Kobe Bryant**\n\n-   20 seasons\n-   1,346 games\n-   5 NBA championships\n-   1x NBA MVP\n-   [**18x NBA All-Star**]{style=\"color: #980239;\"}\n-   33,643 career points\n-   25 PPG\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n### **LeBron James**\n\n-   [**20 seasons**]{style=\"color: #980239;\"} & counting\n-   [**1,378 games**]{style=\"color: #980239;\"}\n-   4 NBA championships\n-   4x NBA MVP\n-   [**18x NBA All-Star**]{style=\"color: #980239;\"}\n-   [**37,371 career points**]{style=\"color: #980239;\"}\n-   27.1 PPG\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment .fade-up}\n*What does this mean?* Still no clear winner based on these initial statistics.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Let's Get Advanced {background-color=\"rgba(223,187,133,.6)\"}\n\nWe turned to various advanced statistics for more clarity and chose to look at each players *Box Plus-Minus(BPM)* throughout their careers.\n\nBPM is a metric that:\n\n-   is derived from a player's own statistics (points, rebounds, and assists, etc.), along with their position, and overall team performance\n-   estimates a player's contribution to the team when that player is on the court in points above the NBA average, which is 0\n-   Example: a BPM of +5 means that per game, the team is 5 points better with the player on the court than with the average NBA player\n\n## BPM: Individual Player vs. Team {background-color=\"rgba(223,187,133,.6)\"}\n\nHow do they stack up against their teammates each season?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#define custom colors\nbullsred = \"#CE1141\"\nlakeryellow = \"#FDB927\"\ncavswine = \"#6f263d\"\n\n#filter dataset for specific players\njustmj<-filter(goat, player == \"Michael Jordan\")\njustkb<-filter(goat, player == \"Kobe Bryant\")\njustlj<-filter(goat, player == \"Lebron James\")\n\n#find PER average for teams and players\nbullavg<-filter(fullnba, Player != \"Michael Jordan\", Tm == \"CHI\", between(Year, 1984, 2003)) %>% summarise(mean = mean(BPM, na.rm=TRUE))\nmjavg<-filter(goat, player == \"Michael Jordan\") %>% summarise(mean = mean(overallbpm, na.rm=TRUE))\n\nlakeravg<-filter(fullnba, Player != \"Kobe Bryant\", Tm == \"LAL\", between(Year, 1996, 2012)) %>% summarise(mean = mean(BPM, na.rm=TRUE))\nkbavg<-filter(goat, player == \"Kobe Bryant\") %>% summarise(mean = mean(overallbpm, na.rm=TRUE))\n\ncavavg<-filter(fullnba, Player != \"LeBron James\", Tm == \"CLE\", between(Year, 2003, 2017)) %>% summarise(mean = mean(BPM, na.rm=TRUE))\nljavg<-filter(goat, player == \"Lebron James\") %>% summarise(mean = mean(overallbpm, na.rm=TRUE))\n\n\n#need to calculate league averages for correct years and add those lines back in\n#need to adjust y axis ranges so they are the same across all three\n\n\n#plots\n#Michael Jordan\nmj<-fullnba %>%\n  filter(Player != \"Michael Jordan\", Tm == \"CHI\", between(Year, 1983, 2004)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=BPM, fill=\"black\"))+\n    geom_point(alpha=.2, size=2)+\n    geom_point(data=justmj, aes(x=year, y=overallbpm, color=bullsred), size=2)+\n    scale_colour_manual(values = bullsred)+\n    #plot league average of ?\n    #geom_hline(yintercept = 15, linetype=\"dotted\")+\n    #plot team average of -2.65\n    geom_hline(yintercept = -2.65, linetype=\"dashed\")+\n    #plot player average of 11.6\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 8.65, linetype=\"solid\")+\n    theme_bw()+\n    theme(\n      legend.position=\"none\"\n      )+\n    labs(\n      title=\"Box Plus/Minus (BPM): Michael Jordan v.
